I am a PhD candidate in the Reynolds Marine and Coastal Ecology lab and the Smyth Biogeochemistry lab at the University of Florida.

My research questions are motivated by both ecological theory and current challenges in ecosystem management and environmental policy. I am broadly interested in how biodiversity promotes ecosystem functioning in natural systems. For my dissertation, I am studying how seagrass species diversity affects meadow stability (or constancy in seagrass cover over time) and how both diversity and stability affect carbon cycling in seagrass meadows. I leverage long-term datasets, field surveys, and laboratory experiments to understand:

- the role of species diversity in meadow persistence and recovery following disturbance  
- how variability in seagrass cover over time affects carbon storage  
- the effects of seagrass species assemblage and traits on greenhouse gas fluxes
