I am a PhD candidate in the Reynolds Marine and Coastal Ecology lab and the Smyth Biogeochemistry lab at the University of Florida. 

I am broadly interested in how biodiversity promotes ecosystem functioning in natural systems. For my dissertation, I am studying how seagrass species diversity affects meadow stability (or constancy in seagrass cover over time) and how both diversity and stability affect carbon cycling in seagrass meadows. I leverage long-term datasets, field surveys, and laboratory experiments to understand:

-the role of species diversity in meadow persistence and recovery following disturbance
-how variability in seagrass cover over time affects carbon storage
-the effects of seagrass traits on greenhouse gas fluxes

My research questions are motivated by both ecological theory and current challenges in ecosystem management and environmental policy.
